Features
========
	* SDL.Vsync
		* lets wait on this -- theres no simple way to use the OS default in SDL unless we just dont touch it, which might be the best thing to do here.
  
GTK
===
	* Better on-the-fly video resizing with window resize / video config
	* Smarter video config (disable widgets that are not used when openGL is enabled)
	* Options to investigate:
		* bpp
		* scanlines
	* GUI Cheat editor

SDL 2.0
=======
	* segfaults when opening a second game
	* segfaults on fullscreen entry
	* has not been tested in a while

BUGS
====
	* F1 from terminal-less gui fceux process hangs fceux (since input is required from console in cheat editor)

OS X
====
	* Single window mode does not work (the XWINDOWID hack does not work in Apples X11 server, so this may never get fixed).
		* It is possible to use GTK to build native OS X menus: http://developer.gnome.org/gtk3/3.4/GtkApplication.html .  It would be awesome to do this and hide the main GTK window if the top bar is available
	* Zapper input is taken from GTK window instead of X11 window (a workaround could be implemented to resolve with with some #ifdef APPLE etc)
	* Not an "official" target, but testing should be done before release on OS X
	* DMG Static binary download for Intel OS X
		* Include needful libaries
		* Adjust scons to produce static binary/libraries with an option
			* http://www.scons.org/wiki/StaticallyLink

DOCS
====
	* Be sure to include details about new scons features for package maintainers so that the manpage, luascripts, and auxlib will be included in future packages
	* Docs REALLY need a cleanup/rewrite
